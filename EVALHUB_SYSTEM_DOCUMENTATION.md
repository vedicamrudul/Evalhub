# EvalHub - Employee Feedback Management System

## üìã Project Overview

**EvalHub** is a Salesforce-based employee feedback management system designed to facilitate monthly departmental feedback collection, review, and management. The system supports three primary user roles: **Executives (Employees)**, **Managers**, and **System Administrators**.

### Core Purpose
- Monthly feedback form creation and distribution
- Employee self-assessment and feedback submission
- Manager review and response to employee feedback
- Administrative oversight and reporting across all departments

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Platform: Salesforce DX Project
- **API Version**: 64.0
- **Framework**: Lightning Web Components (LWC) + Apex Controllers
- **Authentication**: Salesforce Security Model with Custom Profiles and Permission Sets

### Custom Profiles Created:
1. **Executive Profile** - For employees submitting feedback
2. **Manager Profile** - For managers reviewing and responding to employee feedback
3. **System Administrator** - Default admin access

### Permission Sets:
- **Executive Permission Set** - Grants access to custom objects and Apex classes for executives

---

## üë• User Roles & Workflows

### 1. **System Administrator**
- **Creates monthly feedback forms** with custom questions
- **Manages form activation/deactivation** through scheduled processes
- **Views all user responses** across departments
- **Monitors system-wide feedback completion rates**

**Key Components:**
- `createForm` LWC for form creation
- `viewPreviousFormAdmin` LWC for form management
- `viewResponsesPage` LWC for comprehensive reporting

### 2. **Manager**
- **Views all direct subordinates** in their department
- **Reviews employee feedback responses** for their team
- **Submits manager responses** to employee feedback
- **Tracks team feedback completion status**

**Key Components:**
- `viewAllExecutiveUnderManager` LWC for team management
- `viewResponseForExecutive` LWC for individual employee review

### 3. **Executive (Employee)**
- **Submits monthly feedback** on active departmental forms
- **Views their submitted responses** after completion
- **Reads manager feedback** once provided
- **Access to department-specific active forms only**

**Key Components:**
- `employeeQuestionAnswer` LWC for feedback submission and viewing

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Model (Custom Objects)

### 1. **Feedback_Form__c**
Monthly feedback forms created by administrators.

**Key Fields:**
- `Title__c` (Text) - Auto-generated title (e.g., "Sales Feedback January 2025")
- `department__c` (Picklist) - Sales, Marketing, Technical
- `Active_Flag__c` (Checkbox) - Controls form availability
- `Applicable_Month__c` (Date) - Target month for feedback

**Business Logic:**
- Only ONE active form per department at any time
- Auto-activation through scheduled Apex class
- Forms are department-specific

### 2. **Feedback_Question__c**
Individual questions within feedback forms.

**Key Fields:**
- `Feedback_Form__c` (Lookup) - Parent form relationship
- `Question_Text__c` (Long Text Area) - The actual question
- `Input_Type__c` (Picklist) - Text, Picklist, Rating/Number
- `Picklist_Values__c` (Text) - Comma/semicolon separated values for picklist questions

**Question Types Supported:**
- **Text Input** - Free text responses
- **Rating/Number** - Numeric scale responses
- **Picklist** - Pre-defined dropdown options

### 3. **Feedback_Response__c**
Employee responses to feedback questions.

**Key Fields:**
- `Question_Lookup__c` (Lookup) - Links to specific question
- `Rating_Answer__c` (Text) - Stores the response value
- `Responder__c` (Lookup to User) - Who submitted the response
- `Respondent__c` (Lookup to User) - Who the response is about (same as Responder for self-feedback)

**Data Integrity:**
- Prevents duplicate responses per user per question
- Stores responses as text to accommodate all input types

### 4. **Manager_Response__c**
Manager feedback to employee submissions.

**Key Fields:**
- `Feedback_Form_Lookup__c` (Lookup) - Links to the feedback form
- `User_Lookup__c` (Lookup to User) - The employee being reviewed
- `Manager_Response_Test__c` (Long Text Area 500 chars) - Manager's written feedback

**Business Rules:**
- One manager response per employee per form
- Manager can only respond to their direct subordinates
- Responses tied to specific form cycles
