Puzzle - 2 Eggs and 100 Floors
Last Updated : 27 Dec, 2024
The following is a description of the instance of this famous puzzle involving 2 eggs and a building with 100 floors. 

Suppose that we wish to know which stories in a 100-storey building are safe to drop eggs from, and which will cause the eggs to break on landing. What strategy should be used to drop eggs such that a total number of drops in the worst case is minimized and we find the required floor 

We may make a few assumptions: 

An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
A broken egg must be discarded.
The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall.


optimized Method: The idea is to do optimize the solution using the below equation: 

Let us make our first attempt on x'th floor. 

If it breaks, we try remaining (x-1) floors one by one. 
So in worst case, we make x trials.

If it doesn't break, we jump (x-1) floors (Because we have
already made one attempt and we don't want to go beyond 
x attempts.  Therefore (x-1) attempts are available),
    Next floor we try is floor x + (x-1)

Similarly, if this drop does not break, next need to jump 
up to floor x + (x-1) + (x-2), then x + (x-1) + (x-2) + (x-3)
and so on.

Since the last floor to be tried is 100'th floor, sum of
series should be 100 for optimal value of x.

 x + (x-1) + (x-2) + (x-3) + .... + 1  = 100

 x(x+1)/2  = 100
         x = 13.651

Therefore, we start trying from 14'th floor. If Egg breaks on 14th floor
we one by one try remaining 13 floors, starting from 1st floor.  If egg doesn't break
we go to 27th floor.
If egg breaks on 27'th floor, we try floors form 15 to 26.
If egg doesn't break on 27'th floor, we go to 39'th floor.

An so on...

The optimal number of trials is 14 in the worst case.
